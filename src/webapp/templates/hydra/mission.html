  Our mission is to make an easy onboarding process to have a Hydra Node running on Threefold. The whole process should be as simple as possible and fully documented.
  The next step is to create a simple WebApplication that will be deployed to a virtual machine that also contains the Hydra Daemon. This WebApplication will accept user input, and send it to the Hydra Daemon
